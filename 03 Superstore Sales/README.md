# Superstore Sales Analysis

This project was conducted to help a superstore on the brink of bankruptcy identify areas of profit, manage losses, and evaluate potential investments in advertising to boost profitability. Each analysis question is supported by a targeted visualization that drives data-driven recommendations.

## Objectives
<b>Identify Profit & Loss Centers:</b> Locate the main sources of profit and loss by analyzing key product categories, regions, and shipping modes.<br>
<b>Evaluate Advertising Potential:</b> Determine if and where advertising investments would yield high returns based on average profit per unit sold.<br>
<b>Analyze Returned Items:</b> Use return rate data to identify products with high return rates and assess customers or categories driving returns.
## Analysis and Key Findings
### Part 1: Profits & Losses
<b>Profit and Loss Centers:</b> Visualizations pinpointed the top two profit centers and two primary loss-makers, focusing on specific subcategories and regions.<br>
<b>Product Recommendations:</b> Identified products and subcategories to discontinue and highlighted three profitable subcategories to prioritize.
### Part 2: Advertising Strategy
<b>Optimal Advertising Periods:</b> Selected three states with peak monthly profits, visualizing profit trends by month and determining a suggested advertising budget based on projected returns.<br>
Ad Spend Recommendation: Based on a 1/5 profit-to-ad spend ratio, we recommended advertising strategies and budgets for high-profit states.
### Part 3: Returned Items Analysis
<b>Return Rate Insights:</b> Created a calculated field to classify returned items, identifying products and customers with the highest return rates.<br>
<b>Profit vs. Return Rate:</b> Visualized the relationship between profit and return rate by dimensions (e.g., state, shipping mode) to inform business decisions about continuing operations in certain areas.
## Conclusion
The analysis provides actionable insights for enhancing profitability through strategic product focus, advertising in high-return regions, and managing high-return items. These recommendations aim to reduce losses, optimize marketing investments, and improve overall financial health.<br>
